# Lan Tian's Arch Linux PKGBUILDs

> This repository is archived since I've switched to another Linux distribution ([NixOS](https://nixos.org/)).

This repository contains the custom packages I'm running on my Arch Linux system.

These packages are tailored for my own use. There's no guarantee that they will work on your system. There's no guarantee that stuff will not break between upgrades. I do not accept any issues or PRs.

I did not upload any of the packages to AUR, nor did I endorse anyone to do so. Please contact the maintainers on AUR for issues.
